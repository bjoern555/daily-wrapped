# 🌅 Daily Wrapped

**Daily Wrapped** is a browser extension that tracks your daily browsing activity and wraps it up in a clear, local-first dashboard.  
It helps you answer the question: *“What did I even do today?”*

Built with modern tools like **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **shadcn/ui**, it runs privately in your browser and can optionally sync to the cloud via **Supabase**.
